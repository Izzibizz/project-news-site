# News Site

This news site is for our first project in Html and CSS for Technigo Web developer Bootcamp. I chose to work with the theme Bonsai trees.

## The problem

I started off by making a scetch in figma. I had a hard time choosing a topic, since I wanted to choose something that I had never worked with before and that I found interesting. I chose Bonsai because it's a new interest of mine and I could learn some on the way. I then had to focus on and learn github, git, to be able to download the project. My first obsticle I ran into was the fact that I missed that the website should be mobile-first. I have therefore design the website in reverse. I also learned on the way that I could work with grid in a different way. I feel more comfortable with flexbox and therefore apply it more easily, I added a grid towards the end. I learned from that how I could have designed the whole website around where grid works best, instead, and not stay away from it. 
I've been googling like crazy, and solved all of my problems that way. A lot of testing testing testing, to figure out on my own what works. If i had more time I'd work in the design, redo it to a mobile-first design and use grid in a different way.
